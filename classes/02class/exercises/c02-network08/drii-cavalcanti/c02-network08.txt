1. What is the difference between inbound x outbound?
   The difference between inboud(ingress) and outbound(egress) is the direction of the traffic based on the point-of-view of the subnets interface. In other words, inbound is the traffic that an instance receives and outbound is the traffic that an instance sends.
    
2. What is going to happen by default? Everything allowed or denied?
   By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
